## About the Author:
Gaurav Mehan is a third-year Physics Student at UCL.

## Welcome:
This repository is all about trying to predict the climate using the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN). Not only do we, mostly, fail to predict the climate
but we also encounter a number of problems faced in machine learning today. A discussion of the project has been written up in the contained report. 

## Note:
This was a mini-project for my third year PHAS0056 Practical Machine Learning for Physicists course and is far from perfect - so I apolgise in advance.

## Data Sources:
Most of the data has been hosted by the _University College London High Energy Physics (HEP) Group_ courtesy of Prof. Ryan Nichol. 


### Enjoy, and thank you!
